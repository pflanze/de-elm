# Extract text from JavaScript-only Elm-generated webpages

Some(?) websites as generated by the [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)
programming language/system are formatted on the client using
JavaScript. This prevents standardized access to the content, also,
display to the user is only possible through running a JavaSript
interpreter.

The program given in this repository will make an attempt at
extracting the Markdown contents embedded within such websites where
possible.

Exmples:

    ./de-elm 'Elm 0.14.html' | less

    ./de-elm --html http://elm-lang.org/blog/announce/0.14.elm > out.html

## Dependencies

`Text::Markdown` is used when providing the --html option.

`wget` is used when providing a http(s) URL.
